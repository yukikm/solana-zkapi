# Protocol source provenance

`protocol/` is tracked directly by this repository. A normal clone includes the
Rust workspace, Solidity contracts, selected proof setup, and Solidity
dependencies; no submodule initialization or separate protocol checkout is needed.
Make protocol changes here and commit them with the application changes that use
them. The Rust workspace under `rust/` remains separate from the root workspace.

The initial import preserves the files and executable modes from these pinned
revisions, except for the removed `.gitmodules` files:

The third-party libraries retain their upstream license files. Their own
documentation may describe upstream submodule workflows; those workflows do not
apply to this repository. Update these libraries as ordinary tracked files and
record their new revisions here. `contracts/foundry.lock` records the imported
direct dependency versions.

The files in `setup/v2/` are unchanged from the pinned protocol revision. In
particular, this import does not regenerate the proving keys or verifiers.

## Included dependency sources

The import revisions above describe provenance. The included OpenZeppelin
sources are Ownable, Context, ReentrancyGuard and StorageSlot, with their
license. The included forge-std sources are its helpers and licenses.
